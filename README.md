# Breast Cancer Classification with Neural Networks

This project aims to develop a neural network model for classifying breast cancer tumors as benign or malignant based on various features extracted from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses.

## Dataset

The project uses the [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset contains 569 instances of breast cancer tumors, each with 32 features describing the characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the digitized image.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or later
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/breast-cancer-classification.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd breast-cancer-classification
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the Jupyter Notebook:

```
jupyter notebook
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your default web browser.

5. Open the `Breast Cancer Classification.ipynb` notebook and follow the instructions provided.

## Methodology

The project follows these steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Load the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset from the CSV file.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Analyze the dataset to understand its characteristics and identify any potential issues.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Split the dataset into features (X) and target variable (y), and preprocess the data as needed.
4. **Model Building**: Build and train a neural network model using TensorFlow (or any other deep learning library).
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model's performance on the test data using appropriate metrics.
6. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen data.
